## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A terminal that supports ANSI colour codes (most modern terminals do)

### Run the game

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Mayukh-Jain/Sudoku-CLI.git
cd Sudoku-CLI

# Play!
python3 main.py
```

No `pip install` needed — the game uses only Python's standard library.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Puzzle generation** — a complete valid board is built using a randomised backtracking solver, then cells are removed according to the chosen difficulty.
2. **Validation** — every entry is checked against the solution in real time; errors are highlighted immediately without blocking progress.
3. **Rendering** — the board is redrawn on each keypress using ANSI escape codes for colour and a `clear()` call to avoid flicker.
